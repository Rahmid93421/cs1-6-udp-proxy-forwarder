Counter-Strike 1.6 Proxy Server

This program offers basic functionality such as pointing to the desired public game server, custom hostname, map, player count and online players.
The process can be called as a 'redirect', but it's more like forwarding packets back and forth between the client and the public game server using an intermediary proxy server.

The code can be customised for more games and it's not limited to the current configuration.
All of the packets were acquired using Wireshark.

More about the program can be found on this forum post (like compilation etc.): https://bytebattlesarena.net/viewtopic.php?t=12-counter-strike-1-6-udp-proxy-server&p=12#p12
